Sora 2 High-Fidelity Prompt
A high-energy, commercial-style cinematic video focusing on a DIY car modification. The scene begins with an extreme close-up of a hand using a vibrant red oil-based paint marker to meticulously fill in the embossed "CONTINENTAL" lettering on a black rubber tire sidewall. The texture of the rubber is hyper-realistic, showing fine grooves and slight road wear. As the red ink is applied, it exhibits a glossy, wet sheen before drying to a bold matte finish. The camera transitions through a series of rapid, rhythmic cuts: a low-angle tracking shot follows the wheel as it spins at high speed, the red lettering blurring into a continuous ruby streak; then, a close-up shows the tire splashing through a puddle, with water beads and mud droplets realistically repelling off the fresh red paint. The final shot is a handheld, low-angle "hero" pull-away from the rear of a grey modern SUV parked on a damp urban street, revealing the finished look of the red-accented tires which pop against the desaturated pavement. The lighting is a mix of natural overcast daylight and sharp studio-style reflections on the car’s rim, creating a crisp, high-contrast look with deep blacks and saturated reds.
