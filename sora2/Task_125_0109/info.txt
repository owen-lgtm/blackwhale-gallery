标题: Seamless Yoga Set Comfort Stretch Details

提示词:
0-2s: Close-up of a finger tracing the bra’s seamless armhole (UK-style home yoga mat backdrop, potted fern nearby) – zero stitching visible. (Voiceover: "Seamless = total comfort.")
2-4s: Macro shot of the shorts’ fabric – finger presses gently, fabric compresses then bounces back (soft natural light). (No voiceover)
4-6s: First-person hand stretches the bra’s shoulder strap to full length, then releases – instant rebound (neutral white background). (Voiceover: "Stretches & stays put.")
6-8s: Side shot of the set laid flat on a Manchester park bench – focus on the smooth waistband and fabric drape (background: green grass + distant lamp post). (No voiceover)
8-10s: Close-up of the matte logo on the bra – finger brushes the print to show its flat, non-irritating finish. (Voiceover: "Love these subtle details!")
